            Zhongxu is a student in the Department of Electronic Engineering of Tsinghua University. He joined the SPL
            for the summer 2016. He investigated methods to automatically detect in MRI data the tips of the catheters
            used during
            the brachytherapy procedures. After exploring conventional image-based filters, he had great success in
            implementing a Convolutional Neural Network.
